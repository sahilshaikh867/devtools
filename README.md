A documentation-style portfolio capturing my journey of learning **DevOps tools that power modern software delivery**.

This repository is not a tool list — it’s a **map of how software moves from code to production**.

---

## 🚀 What This Repository Is About

- How teams collaborate on code  
- How builds and deployments are automated  
- How applications are containerized and scaled  
- How infrastructure is managed using code  

Each tool here plays a role in that story.
